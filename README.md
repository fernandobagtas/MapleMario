# TheRunback
2D platformer game that I am currently working on right now.

TODO List:
  - Implement dash
  - Implement scoring system 
  - Implement Memory Management (add a queue and store all the tiles as arrays from when they first spawned and deinstantiate whenever the queue fills up)
    - Move invisible wall whenever a section of the play area despawns
  - Implement death condition
  - Modify camera control maybe? IDK yet
