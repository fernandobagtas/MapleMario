# Maple Mario
Maple Mario is a small project I created within a span of a few months. It is an endless platforming game where you, as maple mario, have to traverse through endless spawning platforms and jump across pits of various lengths; and as you progress, the platforms get smaller, and the pits get wider. Just like flappy bird, there is no end to this game, so just try to get as far as you can!
