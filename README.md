# TheRunback
2D platformer game that I am currently working on right now.

TODO List:
  - Implement dash
  - Implement scoring system 
  - Implement death condition
  - Modify camera control maybe? IDK yet
  - Main menu and pause menu 
     - Doesnt have to be complex. Just a play and quit for the main menu and quit and reset for the pause menu is fine
  - Increasing difficulty as the player goes on (increase space between tile spawns and descrease length of tile spawns maybe?)
